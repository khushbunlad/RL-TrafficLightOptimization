# RL-TrafficLightOptimization
This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of optimizing traffic flow by managing a single traffic light at an intersection. The agent will learn to adjust the signal timing dynamically to reduce congestion and improve vehicle movement efficiency.

### Project and environment setup

1. Move to project directory "RL-TrafficLightOptimization" where you have cloned the project
2. Create virtual environment with name **"venvRLTLOP"**
    - Make sure ```python --version``` is set to **12.3.6** in your system
    - ```python -m venv venvRLTLOP```
3. Activate environment
    - ```.\venvRLTLOP\Scripts\Activate.ps1```
    - In case you are using visual studio code, Choose the environment from menu as active environment
4. Install packages mentioned in **"requirements.txt"**
    - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Select **"venvvenvRLTLOP"** environment in your IDE

### Update Requirements.txt file once installing new packages

```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
