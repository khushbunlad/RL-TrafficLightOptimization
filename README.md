### Introduction
This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of optimizing traffic flow by managing a single traffic light at an intersection. The agent will learn to adjust the signal timing dynamically to reduce congestion and improve vehicle movement efficiency.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone repository in your local device using terminal, go to directory where project needs to be saved <br />
    ```git clone https://github.com/khushbunlad/RL-TrafficLightOptimization.git```
2. Move to project directory<br />
    ```cd  RL-TrafficLightOptimization```
3. Make sure ```python --version``` is set to ```3.12.6``` in your system
    - ***If python version is not 3.12.6***, then ***check if it is installed or not***<br />
        ```py -0```
    - If its already available, then move to step 4, else follow C
        - Download python 3.12.6 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3126/  compatible to your device and install.

        - Make sure to mark “add python exe to PATH in” while installation
        - Once installation is complete, again check with  py -0, output should display 
4. Open repository in visual studio code <br />
    ```code .```
5. Open file “ProjectPresentation.ipynb”
6. This file contains all installation and prevention code
7. Click “Run all” from menu bar
8. When it ask for environment, choose one with python 12.3.6
9. It may ask to install “ipkernal” package, click “Yes” and let it install
    Once its installed, it will automatically run all code blocks and browser will open with strimlit simulation.
