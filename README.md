# RL-TrafficLightOptimization
This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of optimizing traffic flow by managing a single traffic light at an intersection. The agent will learn to adjust the signal timing dynamically to reduce congestion and improve vehicle movement efficiency.
